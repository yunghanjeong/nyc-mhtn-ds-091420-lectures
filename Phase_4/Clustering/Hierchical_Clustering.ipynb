    "### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning \n",
    "Recall from our previous lesson in supervised learning, where we use a number of features to predict a label. In unsupervised ML problem, we are not predicting and labels, thus we do not have a ground truth to compare our models to. In other words, we are doing the best we can to group individual observations together without having a gold standard to evaluate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Clustering is a family of techniques for identifying clusters in a dataset. The goal of clustering is to group the most similar observations together into a cluster. In Hierchical Clustering, we prioritize **similarity** between individual observations.\n"

    "# Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering\n",
    "Recall K-means clustering where the goal is to assign individual observations to pre-specified number of clusters according to Euclidean distance between the centroid and the observation, Hierarchical clustering sets out to group the most similar two observations together from a bottom-up level. We end up with a tree-like diagram named **dendrogram**, which allows us to view the clusterings obtained for each possible number of clusters, from 1 to n. It is up to our discretion as data scientists to decide how many clusters we want. \n",
    "***\n",
    "One disadvantage of K-means clustering is that we have to specify the number of clusters beforehand. The type of hierchical clustering we will learn today is **agglomerative**, or **bottom up**, such that we do not have to specify the number of clusters beforehand. We will now dive into the details of hierchical clustering.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### How does the algorithm work\n",
    "Initially, every observation is its own cluster. As we move up the leaf of the dendrogram, the most similar pair of observation fuse together, and the next most similar group of leafs fuse together etc. until everything fuse together into a big cluster. Where to cut off branching that fuse together the tree is up to our discretion. "
